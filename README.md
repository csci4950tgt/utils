## Running web app with docker-compose

1. Make sure you have docker installed locally.
2. Copy the docker-compose file into the root project directory, where `api`,
   `frontend`, and `honeyclient` are all subdirectories
3. Run `docker-compose up`. (this will take a while to build the first time)

That's it.
